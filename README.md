## Domain Name DApp

#### IDEA

###### Create a DApp for purchasing blockchain domain names. As opposed to using DNS that is centralized through ICAAN, a blockchain based domain name allows the users to have:
###### 1. Control over their data
###### 2. Remove third party involvement
###### 3. Censorship resistant websites
###### 4. Provide a one time payment for each domain instead of following a leasing model

#### WORKFLOW 
###### The DApp will contain a smart contract with the following workflow:
###### 1. Users will identify the domain name
###### 2. Users will purchase the domain name
###### 3. Users are able to terminate/transfer the ownership of domain
###### 4. All smart contract owner to transfer the money to their own wallet
